      <p>
      Tomcat (or other servlet containers) are configured to listen on one or 
      more ports, so each request received on one of those ports is targeted
      to a particular webapp based on the name of the .war file deployed under
      the <b>webapps/</b> directory. The targeted webapp is determined based on
      the first directory in incoming requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are two webapps deployed under the <b>webapps/</b> directory,
        called <b>webappA.war</b> and <b>webappB.war</b>, then an incoming
        request <b>/webappA/file1</b> will be received by the webapp inside
        <b>webappA.war</b> as the request <b>/file1</b>. An incoming request
        for <b>webappB/images/foo.gif</b> will be received by the webapp inside
        <b>webappB.war</b> as <b>/images/foo.gif</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomcat (and other servlet containers) allow a special .war file to be
        deployed under the <b>webapps/</b> directory called <b>ROOT.war</b>
        which will receive requests not matching another webapp. If the above 
        example also included a webapp deployed under the <b>webapps/</b> 
        directory named <b>ROOT.war</b>, then requests starting with <b>webappA/</b>
        will be received by <b>webappA.war</b>, requests starting with <b>webappB/</b>
        will be received by <b>webappB.war</b>, and all other requests will be
        receieved by the <b>ROOT.war</b> webapp.
      </p>
      <p>
        If possible, deploying your webapp as <b>ROOT.war</b> will result in
        somewhat cleaner public URLs, but this is not a requirement. The
        examples below all include alternate URL configuration prefixes depending
        on whether you deploy the Wayback .war file as either <b>ROOT.war</b> or
        <b>wayback.war</b>.
      </p>
      <subsection name="AccessPoint Config">
        <p>
          OpenWayback configures how requests <b>that are received by
          the Wayback webapp</b> are routed to the appropriate
          AccessPoint using two properties. The first is the
          <code>internalPort</code> property that should contain the port
          to match. The second is the <code>accessPointPath</code> that
          should contain the complete URL to the accesspoint. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre>
            <![CDATA[
            <property name="accessPointPath" value="http://localhost:8080/wayback/"/>
            <property name="internalPort" value="8080"/>
            ]]>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          These two properties indicates how requests Wayback allows
          targeting AccessPoints based on:
          <ul>
            <li>hostname</li>
            <li>port</li>
            <li>first path <b>after</b> the optional webapp deployment name
            (which is empty if you deploy your Wayback webapp as
            <b>ROOT.war</b>)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <subsection name="ArchivalURL Server-Relative URL rewriting">
        <p>
          As hard as we've tried to make Server-side rewrite "do the right
          thing" in ArchivalURL Replay mode, sometimes things don't work out 
          right. For example, if a page, <b>http://example.net/news/a.html</b>
          contains some Javascript, that generates the following HTML with a
          <b>document.write()</b> call:
          <br></br>
          <code>
          
&lt;img src="/foo.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
          </code>
          <br></br>
          And you were running an AccessPoint at <b>http://archive.org/web/</b>,
          the then page would be expecting that URL to resolve as 
          <b>http://example.net/foo.gif</b>, but in fact, the page being
          displayed as
